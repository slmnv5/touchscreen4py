# touchscreen4py

Linux shared library for Python.

This library is used with (Pepelats audio looper)[https://github.com/slmnv5/pepelats] written in Python. 

It provides graphical output and can reads events from LCD touch screen. 
One specific function I use in python reads word clicked on a screen, this allows to make simple menu in Python.
